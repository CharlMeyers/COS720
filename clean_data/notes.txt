All headers have to start at the beginning of the line and be seperated by a colon. This is standard.
All header values that wrap to the next line have to be indented by a whitespace character. There were a few exceptions to this that was corrected manually.
Dates were corrected to the timezone they were sent in and placed into the yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss format.
Emails that did not contain all of the headers had the header replaced with a blank value.
All emails were compiled into a CSV file for easier processing.
All quotes and commas asre stripped from all the values.
