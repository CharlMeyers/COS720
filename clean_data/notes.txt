All headers have to start at the beginning of the line and be seperated by a colon. This is standard.
All header values that wrap to the next line have to be indented by a whitespace character. There were a few exceptions to this that was corrected manually.
Dates were corrected to the timezone they were sent in and placed into the yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss format.
Emails that did not contain all of the headers had the header replaced with a blank value.
All emails were compiled into a CSV file for easier processing.
All quotes and commas asre stripped from all the values.
Stripped lines with no "To" field.
Stripped the ID part of the message ID and only keep the server.
Added auto-zip functionality.
Emails that didn't have a from server had @enron.com added to them.
